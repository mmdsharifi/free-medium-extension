# Free Medium

A simple chrome extension that lets you read Member-only stories on Medium and Medium-based websites for free.

# How it works

The extension automatically detects when you are on a Medium article. It then turns the main story title (the `<h1>` element) into a clickable link.

Clicking the title will open the same story on `freedium.cfd` in a new tab, bypassing the paywall.

# How to use

1. Install the extension (see below).
2. Navigate to any Medium member-only story.
3. Click the story's main title to open the free version.

# Installation (as Chrome Extension)

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable Developer Mode (toggle in the top right).
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select this folder.
5. The extension will now be active. You may need to accept new permissions if you are updating it.
